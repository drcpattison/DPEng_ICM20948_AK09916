# DPEng_ICM20948 Library including ICM-20948 Breakout Board
DP Eng's Arduino library for the ICM-20948 breakout board with raw sensor data, magnetometer calibration and AHRS examples. Credit to Adafruit for the general library structure. Since the ICM-20948 is the replacement for the now obsolete MPU-9250, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/drcpattison/ICM-20948">ICM-20948 port of the popular MPU-9250 Kris Winer library</a> for this device too.

DP Eng's ICM-20948 Breakout Board is specifically developed for this library with 3 - 5V input including I2C & SPI voltage translation/level shifting and 10k Ohm pull-ups, you can purchase it on eBay or Amazon here:
